# Projects
This Repo contains All C and C++ projects .

1. Airplane Monitoring System:
Developed an Airplane Monitoring System in C to track flight operations, including waypoints, altitude, and emergency landing protocols.
Implemented real-time flight status updates and integrated file handling for waypoint data extraction and distance calculations.

2. Linear Differential Equation Solver (C++)
A C++ program that solves linear differential equations of the form y' + p(x)y = q(x) by extracting and integrating p(x) and q(x). It handles exponential, polynomial, and logarithmic functions using integration by parts.

3. A flexible management system allowing startup CEOs to customize between hotel and hospital management. The system applies core OOP principles such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, and dynamic memory allocation, with additional features like function overloading and virtual destructors for efficient data handling and resource management.
