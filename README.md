# Projects
This Repo contains All C and C++ projects .

1. Airplane Monitoring System:
Developed an Airplane Monitoring System in C to track flight operations, including waypoints, altitude, and emergency landing protocols.
Implemented real-time flight status updates and integrated file handling for waypoint data extraction and distance calculations.

2. Linear Differential Equation Solver (C++)
A C++ program that solves linear differential equations of the form y' + p(x)y = q(x) by extracting and integrating p(x) and q(x). It handles exponential, polynomial, and logarithmic functions using integration by parts.
